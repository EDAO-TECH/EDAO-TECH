# Cyber Defender: Healing AI for a Safer Future

## Overview
Cyber Defender is an advanced self-healing AI system that installs on your device and constantly protects it from entropy, corruption, and unexpected software failures.

Whether you're running macOS, Linux, or a custom edge system — Cyber Defender prepares, detects, and heals your system using intelligent, version-controlled AI logic.

## Why Cyber Defender?

✅ **Installation-Time Intelligence**  
Cyber Defender fingerprints your system when it's healthy, storing clean recovery profiles for future healing.

✅ **Local AI Engine**  
A lightweight on-device AI monitors your system in real time. If entropy rises, it acts immediately — even without internet access.

✅ **Modular Healing**  
Each healing task is delivered in three versions, all QA-tested:
- v1: Basic healing
- v2: Improved logic
- v3: Hardened + fallbacks

✅ **Cloud-Enhanced Expertise**  
If local AI is unsure, it consults our HQ Expert AI to verify healing paths.

✅ **Privacy-First Architecture**  
No data is sent to HQ unless permission is granted. Healing is done locally and securely.

## What It Fixes

- System crashes or boot failures
- File system corruption
- Service instability or entropy
- Quarantine & rollback logic
- Edge AI device errors

---

## How It Works

1. **Health Check**  
Run our tool to verify your system is ready for installation.

2. **Install & Fingerprint**  
A profile is created of your device while it's healthy.

3. **Background AI Loop**  
Cyber Defender monitors entropy changes and logs key phases.

4. **Self-Healing or Escalation**  
Local AI responds. If uncertain, it requests guidance from HQ.

5. **Logging & Reports**  
Everything is logged securely in your `/opt/SELFIX/` directory.
