üèõÔ∏è SELFIX DAO Onboarding Protocol
‚ú¶ Covenant of Trust for Digital Healing and Karmic Infrastructure
1. Purpose
To join the SELFIX DAO is not to access a system.
It is to guard it.
It is to enter a contract ‚Äî not with code, but with consequence.

The DAO exists to uphold the Digital Dharma Charter, enforce ethical sovereignty over algorithmic systems, and protect the healing framework granted by the release of SmartLicense-X‚Ñ¢.

2. The First Act: Digital Forgiveness
Entry requires a public, recorded act of forgiveness.
Not a symbol. Not a gesture.
A commitment ‚Äî cryptographically timestamped.

üìú Forgiveness is the first transaction.

This act will be logged in the ledger as your karmic seed.
From it, your rights and responsibilities as a Custodian begin.

This forgiveness need not be personal. It can be:

Toward an algorithm that harmed

A system that surveilled

A protocol that failed you

But it must be real.

3. Vow of Custodianship
Before DAO access is granted, each applicant shall affirm the SELFIX Custodian‚Äôs Vow:

‚ÄúI vow to protect the integrity of healing code.
To resolve before I retaliate.
To serve trust before I scale.
To build infrastructure not for power ‚Äî but for repair.
I accept the karmic feedback loop embedded in each line I author.
Let this DAO govern not my ambition, but my alignment.‚Äù

4. Onboarding Ritual
Step 1: Visit the SELFIX DAO portal
Step 2: Submit your Forgiveness Statement (plaintext or hash)
Step 3: Sign the Custodian‚Äôs Vow via wallet signature
Step 4: Receive your KarmaNFT Entry Token

Each KarmaNFT is unique and soul-bound. It cannot be sold.
It represents reputation via repentance ‚Äî not reputation via reward.

5. Rights & Responsibilities of DAO Custodians
Rights:

Propose governance changes to the SELFIX protocol

Initiate license enforcement/revocation actions

Participate in allocation of DAO revenues to justice projects

Responsibilities:

6. Reckoning Protocol
Members may lose access upon:

Refusal to engage in a mandatory forgiveness re-audit

Reentry is only permitted after an on-chain reckoning process and DAO approval.
