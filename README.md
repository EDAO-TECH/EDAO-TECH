# 🛡️ SELFIX Cyber Defender — Healing Engine for AI Trust
**Built by @EDAO-TECH**

An autonomous cybersecurity engine that **detects entropy**, **heals digital ecosystems**, and **regenerates trust** through DAO-verified karma scoring and ethical AI simulation.

---

## 🔍 Overview
SELFIX Cyber Defender is a self-healing AI platform governed by the **Book of Forgiveness** and protected by the **SmartLicense-X™** protocol. It is designed to:
- Detect & resolve trust breaches
- Track karma & behavioral risk
- Auto-promote verified healing scripts
- Operate without surveillance or human micromanagement

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔁 Entropy-triggered healing engine
- 🧠 Karma-based behavior scoring (KarmaNFT compatible)
- ⛓️ DAO-anchored legal compliance (SmartLicense-X™)
- 🔐 Cryptographic healing script storage & rollback system
- 📦 Modular: Healing modules, trap logic, rollback manager
- 🎓 Education-ready architecture (curriculum-licensable)
- 🕵️ Zero surveillance design — SELFIX never spies, only restores

📘 Book of Forgiveness v1.0 (Milestone: May 27, 2025)
The Book is a cryptographically verifiable record of all trusted modules. It governs:

Module lifecycle (idea → sandbox → seal)

Version control via .tar.gz hashes

Karma history on healing attempts

DAO access logs and fallback restoration paths

“A system that heals must first remember how it once hurt.”
