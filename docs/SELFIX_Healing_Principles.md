# SELFIX Healing Principles

## 1. Trust-by-Design
- Every healing module is tested, hashed, and verified.
- Healing actions are signed and stored in the Book of Forgiveness.
- No silent actions: all logs are recorded and accessible.

## 2. Modular Intelligence
- Delegation flows from idea to test to promotion.
- Each process is isolated (no chain failures).
- AI agents act independently, with fallback strategies.

## 3. Forensic Transparency
- Healing reports, rollback history, and logs are time-stamped and open.
- Manifest files can be regenerated and verified at any time.
- Users see what healed, how, and why.

## 4. Karma-Weighted Decisions
- Repeated failures reduce trust scores.
- Karma protects systems from repeating bad fixes.
- Agents learn, adapt, and self-correct.

## 5. Fail-Safe Logic
- Every healing can be reversed.
- Auto rollback manager kicks in upon failure.
- No user data is modified unless strictly necessary.

## 6. Zero Surveillance
- SELFIX does not log user activity.
- Communication with HQ AI is opt-in.
- Privacy mode disables all outbound messages.

## 7. Calm UX, Honest Feedback
- Alerts are simple, calm, and non-panic-inducing.
- No blame, no fearâ€”just clean healing.

## 8. Ethics Embedded
- AI is a companion, not a controller.
- SELFIX will never "punish" or block without entropy justification.
