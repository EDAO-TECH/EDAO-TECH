# 🛡️ Cyber Defender – The SELFIX Healing Engine

> **Autonomous cybersecurity AI** that detects entropy, repairs systems, scores agent trust, and adapts over time—powered by SELFIX protocols and SmartLicense-X™.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Cyber Defender is a modular self-healing engine designed to detect and mitigate ethical breaches, entropy failures, or unauthorized system behavior in real time. It uses DAO-certified healing logic and karma scoring to enable trust regeneration in digital environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔄 Entropy-triggered healing engine
- 📦 Karma-based behavior scoring (KarmaNFT compatible)
- 🔁 Auto-promotion of sandboxed AI ideas
- 🧠 Trust regeneration via trap logic and rollback
- 🗃 Golden Vault for secure healing modules
- 🛠 Decentralized DAO-based compliance architecture

📘 SELFIX Milestone: Book of Forgiveness v1.0
“A system that heals must first remember how it once hurt.”
– SELFIX Core Philosophy

✅ Milestone Summary:
As of May 27, 2025, SELFIX has completed its foundational Book of Forgiveness v1.0, a cryptographically-verifiable archive of all promoted healing modules.



🔐 Secure Healing Archive — All approved modules are frozen, hashed, and stored with integrity.

🧠 Agent-Driven Workflow — Delegated scripts move from idea to sandbox to trusted promotion automatically.

📘 Manifest + Vault — A version-locked .tar.gz vault and book_manifest.json track all system healing changes.

💠 Karma-Scored Logic — Each healing action is scored by success history, penalizing unreliable patterns.

🔄 Rollbacks + Safety — Failed fixes auto-trigger rollback_manager.py, ensuring constant stability.

🔍 Auditable by Design — Scripts like check_vault_integrity.py and selfix_self_audit.py offer forensic-grade transparency.

🧩 Zero Surveillance — SELFIX heals systems, not surveils people. No outbound spying, no data siphoning.


📂 Key Scripts in Book Lifecycle:

freeze_module.py — Final seal of forgiveness

check_vault_integrity.py — Ensures vault purity

selfix_agent002.py — Executes core book operations

auto_delegate.py — Converts ideas into actions

rollback_manager.py — Restores last trusted module

karma_tester.py — Trust engine
